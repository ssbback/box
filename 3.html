  <h2>Diggin' My Grave</h2>
<P>You're killing me, baby with the things you do
  <br>Put me in the ground before we're through
  <br>Burning up this town
  <br>Spending everything I've saved, yeah
  <br>You've been out all night
  <br>Diggin' my grave</p>

  <p>Every little lie you're tell kid
  <br>Keep it hid
  <br>You're just another nail on the coffin lid
  <br>Someone else is getting all the love you never gave, yeah (Wooh)
  <br>You've been up all night
  <br>Diggin' my grave</p>

  <p>Some people go runnin' 'round
  <br>They've no need to hurry back
  <br>'Cause I'll be gone from here
  <br>You'll be all dressed up in black
  <br>Six feet under, baby, that's where I'll be
  <br>By the time that you're done with me
  <br>All these tears I cried drowning in a tidal wave
  <br>You've been up all night
  <br>Diggin' my grave</p>
