  <h2>Shallow</h2>
<p>
  <br>[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
  <br>Tell me somethin' girl
  <br>Are you happy in this modern world?
  <br>Or do you need more
  <br>Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?</p>

  <p>[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
  <br>I'm fallin'
  <br>In all the good times
  <br>I find myself longin' for change
  <br>And in the bad times I fear myself</p>

  <p>[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
  <br>Tell me something boy
  <br>Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
  <br>Or do you need more
  <br>Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?</p>

  <p>[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
  <br>I'm falling
  <br>In all the good times
  <br>I find myself longing for change
  <br>And in the bad times I fear myself</p>

  <p>[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
  <br>I'm off the deep end
  <br>Watch as I dive in
  <br>I'll never meet the ground
  <br>Crash through the surface
  <br>Where they can't hurt us
  <br>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
  <br>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
  <br>I'm off the deep end
  <br>Watch as I dive in
  <br>I'll never meet the ground
  <br>Crash through the surface
  <br>Where they can't hurt us
  <br>We're far from the shallow now</p>

  <p>[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
  <br>In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
  <br>We're far from the shallow now
