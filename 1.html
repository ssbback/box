  <br>You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
  <br>It’s buried in my soul Like California gold
  <br>You found the light in me that I couldn’t find</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
  <br>Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
  <br>When the sun goes down And the band won't play
  <br><strong>I'll always <u>remember</u> us this way</strong></p>

  <p>Lovers in the night Poets tryin' to write
  <br>We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try
  <br>But all I really know You're where I wanna go
  <br>The part of me that's you will never die</p>

  <p>So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
  <br>Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
  <br>When the sun goes down
  <br>And the band won't play
  <br>I'll always remember us this way</p>

  <p>Oh yeah
  <br>I don't wanna be just a memory baby yeah</p>

  <p>So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
  <br>Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
  <br>When the sun goes down and the band won't play
  <br>I'll always remember us this way
  <br>Way yeah</p>

  <p>When you look at me and the whole world fades
  <br>I'll always remember us this way</p>
